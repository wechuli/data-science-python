    "In this section, we are going to develop and Recommendation System that will suggest an item to the user, based on the similarity of a particular item, according to his/her interests. Please note, this will be a very basic Recommendation System to suggest similar items. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&#9989; I want to mention that the skill-set in Recommendation Systems could lead you to a very rewarding career that you can built on this course. Once again, this is an optional topic in this course, however, based on the demand, I may put a complete course on developing true robust recommendation system in the near future. At this stage, the purpose of this topic is to make you realize that the knowledge you are getting from this course is unique, and can take you in variety of rewarding and in demand careers!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the project in this lecture, we will be working with movielens dataset. The dataset consist of two `.csv` files, `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`. If you want, you can directly downloaded these files from [the provided link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, for your convenience , both of the files are are provided as a part of this course. At the end of this notebook, links to few other datasets are also provided, you can explore them if you really get interested in the recommender systems! <br>\n",
